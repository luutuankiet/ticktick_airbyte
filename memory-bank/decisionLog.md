2025-08-05 00:04:25 - Decision to pivot to a minimal Proof of Concept (POC) for the TickTick connector.
Rationale: To quickly achieve a functional connector by focusing on core authentication and a single data stream, grounding the implementation in the simplest available methods of the `dida365` client.
Implementation Details: `spec.yaml` revised to use `access_token` instead of username/password; streams simplified to only `Projects`; `check`, `discover`, and `read` methods will be implemented for this minimal scope.
